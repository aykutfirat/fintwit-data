Fun fact: 1993’s “Jurassic Park” hit $914m in box office and took #1 spot as top-grossing film ever. It knocked off 1982’s “ET”. 

Both films directed by Steven Spielberg. 

What film knocked of “Jurassic Park”? “Titanic” in 1997, which I wrote about here:

10. Clustering Bias

Clustering bias occurs when traders perceive, or draw, their own patterns in random data. This can lead to the false identification of trends and strategies based on these perceived patterns, which may not actually exist.

Can anyone explain to Americans how millions of citizens will lose food and healthcare?

Where are the statistics? Statements like this should be supported by facts.

If millions of illegals lose healthcare and food, then it is a positive thing for the programs.

Now that Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has passed, the race is officially underway.

The US will need to grow GDP by an average of 4%-7%+ per year - for the next 10 years - to offset the spending in the bill.

9. Status Quo Bias

Status quo bias is the preference for maintaining the current state of affairs rather than making changes. This lack of flexibility can cause traders to miss out on major market moves.
