Bitcoin has held the regression channel (bull flag) breakout.

Bitcoin is still trading above its 21, 55, and 200-day EMAs.

Those EMAs are in a bullish formation.

Bitcoin is trading above its high daily closes from Q4'24 and Q1'25.

None of these facts are inherently bearish.

a good quant test question would look like this: 
Lets say we play a game where you draw a number uniformly from [0, 1]. You may either keep it or discard it and redraw once, but whichever value you end up with you must keep.  
Your opponent plays under the same rules, privately.

The idea that the GEX metric is actually dealer gamma exposure is a psyop

You should see the way they calculate it. A shitty guess at best (not that shitty guesses aren’t useful) but it’s by no means accurate

Option Selling is not about using $10,000 and turning that into $50,000 in 2 years

Sure, a select few can do that 

But mostly option selling is about stacking up small wins
