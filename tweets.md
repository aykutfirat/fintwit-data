V-shaped recovery in Tech:

Since the April 8 closing low, the US Tech sector ($XLK) is up over 43%, far outpacing every other sector.

The S&P 500 is up 26.5% over the same period, one of the biggest short-term rallies in history.

This is buIIshit.

NOAA’s National Weather Service office in Austin / San Antonio issued a flood watch over 12 hours before the flood, and a flash flood warning THREE hours in advance.

Are they acclaimed as the world's best prawn ?
Answer by Grok, expand to see full conversation
Gambas Rojas de Dénia are often celebrated as one of the world’s finest prawns, but whether they’re universally acclaimed as the best is subjective and depends on culinary perspectives, regional preferences, and comparisons with other renowned prawns. Here’s a balanced look:

Case for Being the World’s Best
Culinary Prestige**: Chefs like Quique Dacosta, whose Dénia restaurant holds three Michelin stars, champion Gambas Rojas de Dénia for their unmatched flavor—intense, iodine-rich, and sweet with a delicate texture. Their head juices are a delicacy, often used in high-end cuisine.
Unique Qualities**: Found at depths of 600–800 meters in the Mediterranean, their diet of fine algae and deep-sea conditions yield a distinctive taste. The vibrant red color and lean, flavorful meat set them apart from common shrimp.
Cultural Significance**: Dénia, a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy, has elevated the prawn to iconic status through festivals like the Concurso Internacional de Cocina Creativa de la Gamba Roja and meticulous fishing practices. This dedication enhances their global reputation.
Gourmet Recognition**: They’re a staple in Spain’s top restaurants and command premium prices (€60–€300/kg), reflecting their demand among food connoisseurs. International food writers and chefs often rave about their purity when prepared simply, like boiled in seawater.

Competing Prawns
Other prawns are also contenders for the “world’s best” title, and preferences vary:
Carabineros (Plesiopenaeus edwardsianus)**: Another Mediterranean red prawn, larger and caught at similar depths, carabineros are prized for their bold, robust flavor, especially in Spain. Some prefer their meatier texture over Dénia’s delicate profile.
Palamós Prawns**: From Catalonia’s Costa Brava, these are similar to Dénia’s but caught closer to shore. They’re lauded for their sweet, clean taste and are a favorite in Barcelona’s markets, sometimes rivaling Dénia’s in local debates.
Spot Prawns (Pandalus platyceros)**: From the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Alaska), these are celebrated for their sweet, buttery flavor and sushi-grade quality. North American chefs often call them the pinnacle of prawns.
Kuruma Prawns (Penaeus japonicus)**: In Japan, these are revered for their crisp texture and subtle sweetness, especially in raw or lightly grilled preparations like ebi nigiri.
Australian Tiger Prawns**: Known for their large size and firm, juicy meat, they’re a favorite in global seafood markets and compete in terms of versatility.

Why It’s Subjective
Taste Preferences**: Dénia’s prawns excel in minimalist preparations that highlight their marine intensity, but some diners prefer the sweeter, meatier profiles of carabineros or spot prawns.
Preparation**: A poorly cooked Gamba Roja loses its magic, while a perfectly grilled Australian tiger prawn might outshine it for some.
Availability and Context**: Dénia’s prawns are rare and costly, making them a luxury experience, but more accessible prawns like those from Palamós or Australia may be favored in everyday dining.
Cultural Bias**: Spanish food culture hypes Dénia’s prawns, while Japanese or Canadian chefs might argue for their local varieties.

What Experts and Diners Say
Chefs**: Quique Dacosta and other Spanish chefs often call Gambas Rojas de Dénia unrivaled for their balance of flavor and elegance in fine dining. However, global chefs like David Thompson (Thai cuisine) might prioritize prawns suited to specific dishes.
Food Media*: Articles from sources like *The New York Times or Condé Nast Traveler praise Dénia’s prawns as a Mediterranean gem but stop short of declaring them the absolute best, often mentioning Palamós or carabineros in the same breath.
Diners**: On platforms like X, food enthusiasts rave about Dénia’s prawns, with posts calling them “insanely delicious” or “worth the price,” but others argue for spot prawns or carabineros based on personal experiences.

Conclusion
Gambas Rojas de Dénia are undoubtedly among the world’s elite prawns, with a strong case for being the best due to their unique flavor, culinary versatility, and cultural prestige. However, they share the spotlight with other exceptional varieties like carabineros, Palamós, or spot prawns, and no single prawn holds an undisputed global crown. If you’re a fan of delicate, iodine-rich seafood, Dénia’s might be your top pick. If you prefer sweeter or meatier profiles, you might lean elsewhere.

Would you like me to search for recent chef opinions or X posts comparing these prawns, or perhaps explore a specific competitor like carabineros?

Chart #1 $BBWI  – Stage 1 Emerging Setup

Just broke a multi-month downtrend and closed above the 30W SMA for the first time since March.

• Trendline snapped
• Squeeze building
• Weekly candle +9.6%

Next level: $34–$35 resistance. A hold above that = early Stage 2 ignition.
